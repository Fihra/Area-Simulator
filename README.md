All assets are created by me, Fabian Fabro, with music, sound effects and art (excuse my art, I'm not great at it).I hope to release this game soon as a browser game on itch.io 

Music is layered by multiple segments of phases throughout the game based on the Player's score, through horizontal fading.

Music Layers
- Title Theme
- Phase I
- Phase II
- Phase III
- Phase IV
- Final Phase

SFX
- Explosions are 3D emitted from the asteroids to pan according to which side they spawn
- Laser also emits to where the Player last shot

I still have some audio ideas for when I start working on the boss functionality.
